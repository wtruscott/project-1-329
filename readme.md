## Project Description

I plan to have a page where jQuery allows enough DOM manipulation that my sections look like new pages. Each Section has the same background and format, but I will change the color "theme" for each section. The themes have a four elements vibe. My project cards will be in a grid with a default look of grayscale until you hover over them.

## Portfolio I want to Emulate

Link To Site  | One Thing I'd Like To Incorporate | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [dbrand](https://dbrand.com/apple-iphone-cases)| Not a protfolio at all, but I'm pulling from this product page for my portfolio layout. |
|[iuri.is](https://iuri.is/) | I think this portfolio has a lot of examples of what i'm trying to achieve with my white text with key words in each sections color "theme" |
| [ejosue.com](https://ejosue.com/) |  I don't like most of this page, but if you scroll to his projects "Case Studies" you can see the hover effects that are similat to what I want to implement albeit I want to go from grayscale to color. |
